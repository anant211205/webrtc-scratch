# WebRTC Scratch Project: Behind the Scenes (BTS), How It Works, and Project Overview

## Overview

The **WebRTC Scratch** project is a practical demonstration of how WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) works at a fundamental level. It aims to demystify peer-to-peer browser communication by building the essential components from the ground up, without relying on external abstractions or complex libraries.

---

## What is WebRTC?

WebRTC allows browsers to establish direct, real-time communication between users. This can be used for video calls, voice chats, or even sending files and messages, all without needing to install plugins or software.
---

## Project Architecture

The project is composed of three primary parts:

1. **Frontend:**  
   Handles the user interface and captures audio/video streams via the browser.
2. **Signaling Server:**  
   A minimal server (commonly Node.js + WebSocket) that helps peers discover each other and exchange initial connection data.
3. **Peer Connection Logic:**  
   JavaScript code in the browser that manages session negotiation, ICE candidate handling, and media/data transmission.

       \         WebRTC P2P         /
        +--------------------------+

## How WebRTC Works Behind the Scenes

### 1. Signaling

WebRTC itself does NOT specify how peers should find each other.  
In this project, a basic signaling server is used to exchange messages such as **offer**, **answer**, and **ICE candidates**.

- **Offer/Answer:** Exchange of session descriptions (SDP) so browsers know how to communicate.
- **ICE Candidates:** Exchange of network information to help peers connect through NAT/firewalls.

### 2. Establishing PeerConnection

Once signaling is complete, both browsers create an `RTCPeerConnection`. This object:
- Handles encryption and connection negotiation.
- Manages ICE for NAT traversal.
- Allows adding media (audio/video) or data channels.

### 3. Media and Data Channels

- **getUserMedia:** Used to capture audio/video from the user’s device.
- **Tracks:** Media tracks are attached to the peer connection and streamed directly to the other peer.
- **RTCDataChannel:** (Optional) For sending arbitrary data (e.g., text, files) directly.

## Example Flow

1. **User A** clicks "Start Call" and their browser captures audio/video.
2. **User A** sends an offer via the signaling server.
3. **User B** receives the offer, creates an answer, and sends it back.
4. Both exchange ICE candidates to find the best network path.
5. Once negotiation is done, browsers communicate directly.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Make sure you are using a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Allow camera/microphone access.
- Ensure the signaling server is running and both peers can connect to it.
- Check for typos or errors in the JavaScript console.

## Why Build WebRTC from Scratch?

Building each piece yourself helps you understand:
- How real-time data and media flows work on the web
- The importance of the signaling process
- The complexities of NAT traversal and peer connectivity

## Conclusion

This project is a stepping stone for anyone looking to learn real-time web communication. By exploring WebRTC from first principles, you gain a deep understanding of browser-based P2P communication.
